A collaboration with Technigo's UX/UI Design bootcamp students. Our assigment was to turn a landing page for a fitness club (in my group's case, a power yoga studio) made in Figma into code, using React.

### The problem

This week's new topic was Styled Components. I wanted to really get into the logic of the library and understand why and when it can be useful. I styled the entire landing page with Styled Components only, and can say that I really enjoyed the process (though a bit complex at first) and will definitely keep using this way of styling React.
